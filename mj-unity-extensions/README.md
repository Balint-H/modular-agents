# Extensions for the MuJoCo plugin
This package contains features and extensions that are independent of ML-Agents, and may be relevant to any user of the MuJoCo plugin in Unity. 
Most of its content are utility functions for common operations, such as:
- Getting the in-simulation state of MuJoCo components (even before synchronisation)
- Teleporting kinematic chains
- Copying states from one kinematic chain to another
- Querying and managing contacts.
