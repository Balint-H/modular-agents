# Modular-Agents core components

This package contains ML-Agents components that are agnostic about learning environment details, and humanoid control specific components that are shared between PhysX and MuJoCo implementations. 
We recommend reading the Readme-s of the [RL-Signal scripts](<./Runtime/RL Signals/README.md>) and the [training event system](<./Runtime/Training Event System/README.md>). See the UnityMjExample project in the root repository for an example application of these components.
