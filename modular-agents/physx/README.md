# PhysX Components

This repository is in a pre-alpha stage. Most PhysX versions of scripts have been verified to work, but we have yet to train a control model with the updated package. We are releasing this along with the other parts of the package to involve others interested in developing it.

We want to first have a good equivalent humanoid in MuJoCo and PhysX and then retrain models for comparisons. An existing `ArticulationBody` based humanoid is included (one that is different from the MuJoCo one), that has been tested with DReCon and DeepMimic before.
